# Specs

This is a playground trying to write various algorithms in
specification languages like Alloy and TLA+

They're pretty rough; I wouldn't use these as any sort of real
example.  But it's important to try various things and learn,
and have a record of that learning, so if it's useful to anyone,
that's lovely.
